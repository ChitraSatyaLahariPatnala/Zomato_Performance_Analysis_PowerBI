## Objective  
The objective of this project was to analyze Zomato’s performance data and uncover insights on:  
- Sales and revenue trends
- City-level performance  
- User demographics and engagement  
- Category-wise order patterns  
- Retention vs churn behavior  

## Dashboard  
The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:  
- KPI cards for **Sales, Orders, Ratings, Active Users, and Lost Users**  
- **Category-wise performance** (Veg, Non-Veg, Others)  
- **User analysis** by age and gender  
- **City-level breakdown** of sales and ratings  
- Year-over-year trends for better decision-making

## Tools & Skills Used  
- **Power BI** – Power Query, DAX measures, Interactive Visuals

##  Key Insights   
- The dataset records **over 987M in sales** generated from **150K+ orders** and **148K ratings**, showing Zomato’s strong market presence.  
- **Non-Veg items** dominate overall sales with **106M+ revenue**, while Veg and Others categories trail behind.  
- **Tirupati emerged as the top-performing city**, with the highest sales, order volume, and active user engagement.  
- **Age group 20–30 years contributes the largest share of users**, reflecting Zomato’s popularity among younger demographics.  
- **Gender analysis** shows male users ordering slightly more frequently than female users, though engagement remains high across both groups.  
- Nearly **33K users were lost** within the recorded period, which signals an area of concern for retention.  
- Certain cities such as **Raipur and Baner (Pune)** showed lower performance despite decent user base sizes, suggesting underutilized potential.

## Business Improvements  
Based on the analysis, Zomato can take the following actions to strengthen its performance:  
1. **Promote Veg and Other Categories** → Launch offers, discounts, and campaigns to balance the dominance of Non-Veg sales.  
2. **Retention Strategy** → Introduce loyalty rewards, cashback, and personalized notifications to reduce user churn (~33K users lost).  
3. **Regional Growth Focus** → Cities like Raipur and Baner should be targeted with localized marketing campaigns and partnerships with popular local restaurants.  
4. **Youth Engagement** → Since the 20–30 age group dominates, Zomato can expand student/youth-focused offers to further strengthen loyalty.  
5. **Customer Experience** → Enhance service in low-performing areas and ensure faster delivery to boost satisfaction and repeat orders.
